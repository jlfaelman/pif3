        For us giving to others without expecting something in return and forwarding the kindness receive is the whole
        concept of Pay It Forward.

        Pay it Forward was started because of our group's passion, we believe in the beauty of gift giving and wish to
        help others who are in need.

        Using the skills and knowledge we learned at our school Institute of Technology, we made it our personal mission
        to turn our dream into a reality.
